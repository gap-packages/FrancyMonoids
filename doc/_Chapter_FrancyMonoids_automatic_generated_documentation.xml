  <Oper Arg="f" Name="DrawFactorizationGraph" Label="for IsRectangularTable"/>
 <Returns>a drawing
</Returns>
 <Description>
f is a set of factorizations
Draws the graph of factorizations associated to f: a complete graph
 whose vertices are the elements of f. Edges are labelled with
distances between nodes they join. Kruskal algorithm is used to
draw in red a spannin tree with minimal distances. Thus the catenary
degree is reached in the edges of the tree.

  <Oper Arg="f" Name="DrawEliahouGraph" Label="for IsRectangularTable"/>
 <Returns>a drawing
</Returns>
 <Description>
f is a set of factorizations
 Draws the Eliahou graph of factorizations associated to f: a graph
 whose vertices are the elements of f, and there is an edge between
two vertices if they have common support. Edges are labelled with
distances between nodes they join.

 <Description>
Draws the tree of sons of numerical semigroups up to level l with
  respect to the minimal system of generators given by the function
generators.

<ManSection>
  <Func Arg="s,A" Name="DrawHasseDiagramOfNumericalSemigroup" />
 <Returns>a drawing
</Returns>
 <Description>
plots a graph whose set of vertices is A, which is a finite set of
integers, and whose edges are provided by the order of the numerical
semigroup s.

  <Func Arg="s,[expand]" Name="DrawTreeOfGluingsOfNumericalSemigroup" />
 <Returns>a drawing
</Returns>
 <Description>
Returns a Francy canvas with the tree of gluings of the numerical
semigroup s. If the optional argument expand is provided, then
the tree is drawn fully expanded.
