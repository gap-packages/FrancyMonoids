# francy-monoids

A GAP package with graphic tools related to commutative monoids

This package requires [francy](https://github.com/mcmartins/francy) and [numericalsgps](https://github.com/gap-packages/numericalsgps).

## Implemented tools

### Hasse diagrams

- `DrawHasseDiagramOfNumericalSemigroup`
- `DrawOverSemigroupsNumericalSemigroup`

### Graphs

- `DrawRosalesGraph`
- `DrawEliahouGraph`
- `DrawFactorizationGraph`

### Trees 

- `DrawTreeOfGluingsOfNumericalSemigroup`
- `DrawTreeOfSonsOfNumericalSemigroup`

## Example

See the example in this [notebook](https://github.com/pedritomelenas/francy-monoids/blob/master/Examples/francy-monoids.ipynb).
